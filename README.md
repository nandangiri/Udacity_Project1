Wine Review Data Analysis

### Installations
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Wordcloud
- Pillow

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Project Motivation
We want to work on exploratory analysis using a Wine Review data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews) from Kaggle having 130k reviews from the Wine Enthusiast (https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine) to try and understand:

- Is price related to quality?
- What is the best wine in each price bracket?
- What words are most used when talking about wine?

This is a great opportunity to talk about findings with a blog post on Medium which helps the reader understand and explain the questions posed.

### File Descriptions
There is ad exploratory notebook. Markdown cells are used throughout to explain the process.

### Medium Blog Post
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available here

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
Acknowledgement should go to Kaggle and zackthoutt for providing the dataset. Acknowledgement should also go to DataCamp for their excellent WordCloud tutorial.
