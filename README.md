No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

### Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Wine Review dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews)] found on Kaggle containing approximately 130k reviews from the [Wine Enthusiast (https://www.winemag.com/?s=&drink_type=wine)] to better understand:

- Where does the best wine in the world come from?
- Is price related to quality?
- Are certain varieties of wine higher quality?
- What is the best wine in each price bracket?
- What words are most used when talking about wine?

I wanted the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium in what is hopefully an engaging post which gives the reader insight into the questions posed.

### File Descriptions
There is one exploratory notebook available here to showcase my work related to the questions posed. Markdown cells were used throughout to explain the process taken.

### Medium Blog Post
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available here

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
Acknowledgement should go to Kaggle and zackthoutt for providing the dataset. Acknowledgement should also go to DataCamp for their excellent WordCloud tutorial.
